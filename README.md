# Stimulus Elements

A collection of Stimulus elements that are agnostic of the CSS framework.

**This package is still a work in progress and is not production ready**

## Modification

Working on a couple of personal projects with TailwindCSS and Flowbite, I realized there were not many component 
packages that did not assume the UI framework or how you want Components to appear.

I wanted a simple component framework that handled the component interactions and allowed me to control the design
of the component.

## TODO

[] Add Tests
[] Add Documentation
